# Interactive Matching Network for Multi-Turn Response Selection
This repository contains the source code and datasets for the CIKM 2019 paper [Interactive Matching Network for Multi-Turn Response Selection in Retrieval-Based Chatbots](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3358140) by Gu et al. <br>

Our proposed Interactive Matching Network (IMN) has achieved a new state-of-the-art performance on four large-scale datasets that are publicly available for research on multi-turn conversation.

## Train a new model
Take Ubuntu_V1 as an example.
```
cd scripts
bash ubuntu_train.sh
```
The training process is recorded in ```log_train_IMN_UbuntuV1.txt``` file.

## Test a trained model
```
bash ubuntu_test.sh
```
The testing process is recorded in ```log_test_IMN_UbuntuV1.txt``` file. And your can get a ```ubuntu_test_out.txt``` file which records scores for each context-response pair. Run the following command and you can compute the metric of Recall.
```
python compute_recall.py
```
